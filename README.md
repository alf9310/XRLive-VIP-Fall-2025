# XRLive-VIP-Fall-2025
XRLive: Computational Tools for Live Performance. Live visual effects for the NTID Dance Production of Pure Imagination: The Magical Candy Factory which will be presented in April of 2026.

The main effects being researched and implemented are as follows:
## Water Effects
Exploring how the hand movements of the actors can guide a water-like effect for underwater scenes.
## Water Ripples
Creating "Dancing in the Rain" style ripples and raindrops by tracking the actor's feet to create splashes.
## Actor Shadow Projection
Mapping the outline of the actors onto a painting canvas behind them, making it appear as if they've come from inside the painting.
## Fabric Effects
Mimicing the hand and fabric cloth movements as if a dancer is performing with a fabric cloth in water scenes.
## Fading Projection Map
Project light effects onto the actor and lower saturation, to make it appear as if they'd gone into black & white.
