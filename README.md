# XRLive-VIP-Fall-2025
XRLive: Computational Tools for Live Performance. Live visual effects for the NTID Dance Production of Pure Imagination: The Magical Candy Factory which will be presented in April of 2026.

The main effects being researched and implemented are as follows:
Water Movement:
* Exploring how the hand movements of the actors can guide a water-like effect for underwater scenes.
Wster Ripples:
* Creating "Dancing in the Rain" style ripples and raindrops by tracking the actor's feet to create splashes.
Actor Shadow Projection:
* Mapping the outline of the actors onto a painting canvas behind them , making it appear as if they'd jumped from the painting.
Light Projection Mapping:
* Project light effects onto the actor and lower saturation, to make it apear as if they'd gone into black & white.
